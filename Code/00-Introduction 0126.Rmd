## Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)[^1][^2]:

- affects ~25% of the global adult population
- compasses NAFL (fatty liver) and NASH (steatohepatitis)
- can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- is the fastest growing cause of HCC

## Relationships between NAFLD and other disease

- NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, diabetes, CVD[^3]
- Drastically increased in patient groups with these diseases

## Mechanisms of NAFLD development and therapeutic strategies

**Management strategies (lifestyle interventions)**

- weight loss
- healthier life style habits (physical exercises, diet etc.)

**Molecular aspects (heterogeneous):**

- many molecular pathways that contribute to the development of NAFLD
- pathogenic drivers are not likely to be identical among all patients


**There are still no approved pharmacological therapies for NAFLD!!**[^4]

## Aim & Method

- investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD progression

**RNA sequencing data**[^5]

## Basic analysis and advanced analysis

- Raw sequencing reads in fastq format
- Mapped to the genome using alignment software
- Summarise reads over genes to generate a count table
- Determine differentially expressed genes using R
- Exploratory analyses: pathway enrichment and disease association analysis

## Data

- Public datasets shared by other study[^6] and metadata can be found from GEO

[GSE135251](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135251)

- fastq files can be found in ENA database based on its projectID

[PRJNA558102](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA558102?show=reads)
